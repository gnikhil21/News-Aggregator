       "  'text': 'Machine Learning is an area of research that allows machines the ability to learn without being directly programmed. Machine Learning development is in trend as many students, teachers, developers, and data scientists use machine learning to develop various projects and products. However, developing machine learning models require high system requirement specifications as sometimes the model training process can go from 2 hours to 2 days and more. So low-end systems can not handle training of good machine learning models or even if they somehow train models, critical system issues are likely to occur.\\n\\nHowever, there are many open-source Machine Learning environments available that do not require any system requirement specification and use cloud infrastructure to train your model in the most optimal time possible. Below are the most efficient, commonly used online machine learning environments:\\n\\nIt’s a cloud service that can be easily accessed to develop products and projects, provided by Google. It supports free GPUs and is based on the Jupyter Notebooks setting. It provides a forum for everyone to build machine learning and deep learning applications using widely used libraries like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras. It offers a way for your system not to take out the full workload of your ML activities.

Eventually, it launched the multi-cloud freedom of choice platform for data science work. This was achieved with the help of containerization of the stock by Kubernetes. As a consequence, it can be distributed in Docker or CloudFoundry containers wherever the data is stored.\\n\\nRAM – 16 GB\\n\\nDisk Space – 90 GB\\n\\n– 90 GB CPU Cores – 4\\n\\n– 4 Languages Supported – Apache Spark, Python, R, Scala\\n\\nIt’s an excellent platform for deep learning and machine learning applications in the cloud. Kaggle and Colab have a variety of similarities, both being Google products. It supports the Jupyter Notebooks in the browser. Many of the Jupyter Notebook keyboard shortcuts are almost the same as Kaggle. Kaggle has a large collection of datasets and has a broad community devoted to promoting, learning, and validating data science skills.

       "  'text': 'March 03, 2023 11:10 am | Updated March 04, 2023 01:09 am IST - New Delhi\\n\\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said better infrastructure has put remote Indian villages on the tourist map as has redevelopment of religious centers like Varanasi’s Kashi Vishwanath Temple.\\n\\nAddressing a post-Budget webinar on the subject of ‘Developing Tourism in Mission Mode’, Mr. Modi said it was a myth that tourism is a fancy word associated only with the high-income groups of the country.\\n\\nHe noted that ‘yatras’ have been a part of India’s cultural and social life for centuries and people used to go on pilgrimages even when there were no resources available to them and gave the example of Char Dham Yatra, Dwadash Jyotirling Yatra and 51 Shaktipeeth Yatra.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister said that these places had been neglected over the years due to hundreds of years of slavery and the political neglect in the decades after Independence.\\n\\n“The India of today is changing this situation”, he said noting that the increase in facilities leads to an increase in attraction among the tourists.\\n\\nMr. Modi gave the example of Kashi Vishwanath Dham in Varanasi and said that around 80 lakh people used to visit the temple in a year before it was rebuilt, but the tourist footfall crossed 7 crore last year after the renovation. He also mentioned that 15 lakh devotees have visited Kedarnath Temple compared to only 4-5 lakh before the completion of reconstruction work in Kedarghati.\\n\\nAlso read | PM Modi pitches for the development of new cities and modernisation of urban infrastructure\\n\\nThe Prime Minister underlined that India’s tourism sector can grow manifold with increase in civic amenities, good digital connectivity, good hotels and hospitals and excellent infrastructure. He gave the example of Indian villages.\\n\\n“Our villages are becoming centers of tourism”, the Prime Minister remarked as he underlined that remote villages are now coming up on the tourism map due to their improving infrastructure. The Central government has started the Vibrant Village Scheme for the villages situated along the border, he said emphasising the need to support businesses such as homestays, small hotels and restaurants.\\n\\nHe said India needs to think out of the box and plan ahead to take tourism to new heights. Throwing light on the parameters for the development of a tourist destination, Mr. Modi listed the potential of the place, ease of travelling to the destination and new ways to promote the destination.\\n\\n“Every tourist destination can also develop its own revenue model”, he said.\\n\\nPTI adds:\\n\\nThe webinar is part of a series of 12 post-budget webinars being organised by the government to seek ideas and suggestions for effective implementation of the initiatives announced in the Union Budget.\\n\\nThe Union Budget has stated that promotion of tourism will be taken up in mission mode, with active participation of states, convergence of government programmes and public-private partnerships.\\n\\nIf civic amenities are increased, there is good digital connectivity, good hotels and hospitals, and cleanliness, India\\'s tourism sector can grow manifold, he said.\\n\\nThe Prime Minister said wedding destinations are a big business now, and this has a huge potential in India.\\n\\n\"We should develop at least 50 tourist destinations which will appear on the list for tourists whenever they think of visiting India,\" he added.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'March 04, 2023 11:34 am | Updated 01:02 pm IST\\n\\nIn response to the rising cases of cough, cold and nausea across the country, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has advised against an indiscriminate use of antibiotics like Azithromycin and Amoxiclav to alleviate symptoms.\\n\\nThe IMA noted that most cases of seasonal cold and cough — resulting in nausea, sore throat, fever, body ache and diarrhoea in some cases — currently being reported are due to the H3N2 influenza virus. While the fever should last up to three days, the cough can continue for three weeks. Viral cases have also surged due to air pollution, they noted.\\n\\nIndian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) scientists have also said Influenza A subtype H3N2 is responsible for the persistent cough, sometimes accompanied by fever, in India for the past two months, reported PTI. The H3N2 subtype notably causes more hospitalisation than other variants.\\n\\nAntibiotics for seasonal colds are ineffective; their overuse and misuse can result in antibiotic resistance which can make bacterial infections a public health threat. There is a trend where physicians prescribe antibiotics despite patients not exhibiting relevant symptoms, the IMA said.\\n\\nFever cases on rise - Avoid Antibiotics pic.twitter.com/WYvXX70iho — Indian Medical Association (@IMAIndiaOrg) March 3, 2023\\n\\n“Right now, people start taking antibiotics like Azithromycin and Amoxiclav etc, that too without caring for done and frequency and stop it once start feeling better. This needs to be stopped as it leads to antibiotic resistance. Whenever there will be a real use of antibiotics, they will not work due to the resistance,” IMA said in a statement.\\n\\nInstead, physicians should practice “self-control” and “regulation”, and apply medical therapy that affects the symptoms in question. Good hand and respiratory hygiene, avoiding crowded places and taking vaccines is further recommended by the IMA.\\n\\n“It is necessary to diagnose whether the infection is bacterial or not before prescribing antibiotics,” the association noted.\\n\\nALSO READ | Overuse of antibiotics, not completing medicine course harmful: doctors\\n\\n“It is necessary to diagnose whether the infection is bacterial or not before prescribing antibiotics,” the association noted.\\n\\nThey took the example of azithromycin and ivermectin usage during COVID-19 to allude to the pitfalls of over-prescribing antibiotics without sufficient evidence.\\n\\nAntibiotics sale soared during the pandemic in India, where they where frequently being used to treat symptoms like cold and cough, according to a 2021 research led by Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.\\n\\n“Antibiotic resistance is one of the greatest threats to global public health,” said the study’s senior author, infectious diseases specialist Sumanth Gandra, MD, an associate professor of medicine and an associate hospital epidemiologist at Barnes-Jewish Hospital. “Overuse of antibiotics lessens their ability to effectively treat minor injuries and common infections such as pneumonia, which means that these conditions can become serious and deadly. Bacteria that have become resistant to antibiotics don’t have boundaries. They can spread to any person in any country.”\\n\\nA 2019 study also found that AMR is estimated to cause 10 million deaths annually by 2050.\\n\\nIndia’s antibiotic consumption is a worrying trend among health practitioners and activists. Globally, India tops the list of countries with the highest antibiotic consumption, and the highest antimicrobial resistance (AMR) cases. A study published in The Lancet Regional Health—Southeast Asia found the prevalence of a high volume of broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as Azithromycin, and unapproved formulation of drugs.\\n\\nKey factors that have allowed unabated usage of antibiotics include lack of awareness among patients and practitioners, unrestricted drug manufacturing, and tepid regulations around antibiotic production and distribution, researchers have previously said.'}]"
