During the program\'s reveal Friday, Lieuetant Ryan Harris addressed the first question that probably popped into everyone\'s mind.\"No. \nIf your car is not reported stolen, we will not, we cannot track you,\" he said Anyone who lives in Denver and has a tracking device in their vehicle — like OnStar, Bluelink, an Apple AirTag, etc., — can participate in the program by registering on Denver PD\'s website. There, you will be asked to provide your vehicle information, proof that you are the registered owner, and preauthorize the department to access the device.',
